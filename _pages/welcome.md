Tired of the status quo? Me too. That's why I leverage my experience as a Senior Consultant at EY's AI & Data practice, coupled with a double major in Computational Data Science and Business Analytics from Georgia Tech, to bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and real-world business needs.

Here's where the magic happens: I'm passionate about harnessing the power of data science, product analytics, machine learning, and predictive modeling to tackle complex challenges.
