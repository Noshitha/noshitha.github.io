I am currently a Graduate student of the MS Analytics program at Georgia Institute of Technology specializing in Computational Data Analytics. My primary interests are in the fields of data mining, predictive analytical modeling and Machine Learning.  

This website showcases my projects as I tackle some real-world data using skills gained during my masters program.
