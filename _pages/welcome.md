I am currently a PhD candidate at Oklahoma State University in the Department of Computer Science under [Dr. Johnson Thomas](https://www.cs.okstate.edu/~jpt/). My primary research interests are in the fields of Machine Learning and Bio-inspired decision making models. My research focusses on analysis and implementation of *neural computational models* inspired by the human brain using Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). While there are several studies that specifies mathematical and theoretical realizations of biologically inspired models, there is a lack of practical application and implementation of such models. My research addresses such limitions by marrying both the theoretical and practical aspects of building biological models with emphasis on tractable design and practical use cases by solving computational tasks of pattern recognition and prediction.

Supplementing my research on computational models, I also am interested in brining Machine Learning to understand the human brains functionalities by studying and applying various research works in this field. As I move towards my graduation, I am looking forward to solving challlenging problems in the field of Machine Learnind and Deep Learning and this website serves as a showcase of my projects as I tackle some real world data using skills gained during my time as a PhD research scholar in Computer Science.
